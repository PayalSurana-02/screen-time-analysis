# Screen Time & Well-being Analysis

This project explores the impact of screen time on sleep quality, physical activity, and academic performance across two groups â€” adolescents (8â€“17) and adults (18+). Using two structured datasets from Kaggle, we cleaned, merged, and visualized data to compare lifestyle trends and uncover meaningful insights.

ðŸ“˜ *Project completed as part of CIS 9655 â€“ Data Visualization at Baruch College.*

## Project Highlights

- Cleaned and merged multiple datasets with age, screen time, grades, and sleep duration
- Created age bins and standardized metrics for comparison
- Built visualizations using **Seaborn**, **Matplotlib**, and **Plotly**
- Performed correlation analysis and grouped comparisons by age range
- Summarized findings through a visual presentation and recorded explanation

## Key Insights

- Adults averaged higher grades but had less sleep and more screen time
- No strong correlation between screen time and grades or sleep in either group
- Quality and context of screen time likely more important than quantity
- Visualization helped distinguish behavioral patterns across age ranges
